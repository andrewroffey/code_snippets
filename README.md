# code\_snippets
A collection of random code snippets, mostly functions, classes, methods etc. that I wrote and could be useful on their own.

## License
The code snippets are small and may not even be eligible for copyright due to the threshold of originality. Nonetheless, to remove any doubt, these snippets are available under a CC0 1.0 Universal license. If by some chance any of these are used in a larger project, consider making it available under a copyleft license such as the GPL.
